# Privacy Policy

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this
policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.

1.  ## What information do we collect?

    We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data.

    1.  Information about your visits to and use of this website.

    2.  Information about any transactions carried out between you and us on or
        in relation to this website, including information relating to any
        downloads you make of our goods.

    3.  Information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our
        website services and/or email notifications.

2.  ## Information about website visits:

    We may collect information about your computer and your visits to this
    website such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type,
    referral source, length of visit and number of page views. We may use this
    information in the administration of this website, to improve the website's
    usability, and for marketing purposes.

    We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server
    to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back
    to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This
    enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.

    Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. (For example, in
    Internet Explorer you can refuse all cookies by clicking "Tools", "Internet
    Options", "Privacy", and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding
    selector.) This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of
    many websites, including this one.

3.  ## Using your personal data:

    Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes
    specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.

    In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may
    use your personal information to.

    1.  Improve your browsing experience by personalizing the website.

    2.  Send information (other than marketing communications) to you, which we
        think, may be of interest to you by post or by email or similar
        technology.

    3.  Send to you marketing communications relating to our business or the
        businesses of carefully selected third parties, whom we think, may be of
        interest to you by post or, where you have specifically agreed to this,
        by email or similar technology.

    4.  Provide other companies with statistical information about our users â€“
        but this information will not be used to identify any individual user.

4.  ## Using your non-personal data:

    Non-personal data is collected and shared with the service AdRoll to provide
    relevant and targeted advertisements through retargeting. All data is
    anonymous and cannot be used to identify the visitor. Retargeting recognizes
    that the Internet browser has visited the website in the last 180 days.

5.  ## Other disclosures:

    In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes
    identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may disclose information
    about you.

    1.  To the extent that we are required to do so by law.

    2.  In connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal
        proceedings.

    3.  In order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including
        providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and
        reducing credit risk).

6.  ## Security of your personal data:

    We will take reasonable precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or
    alteration of your personal information. Of course, data transmission over
    the Internet is inherently insecure, and we cannot guarantee the security of
    data sent over the Internet.

7.  ## Policy amendments:

    We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version
    on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are
    happy with any changes.

8.  ## Third party websites:

    The website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the
    privacy policies of third party websites.
