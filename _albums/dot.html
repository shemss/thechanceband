<h1>Album Dot started in a very interesting environment</h1>

<p>The idea of this album came to existence in 2015 when we decided to meet
for a cup of coffee in downtown, at the tower café. You can say spontaneously
but it’s as if fate was on our side.</p>

<p class="more visible-lg">
  It was over that cup of coffee when one of us suggested we finish what we
  started so many years before. As CHANCE we haven’t been playing in a while,
  but in reality we just drifted, we were and always will be a band, no matter
  where life takes us. We were sitting there, reminiscing on the old days how
  when we playing together there was this happiness that came over us, its as
  if we drifted into the presence of God &amp; it straightened us not only as
  a band but as friends. Each of us missed being in that very presence, we
  realized it would be a shame not to share that with the world. With the
  support and love of our families we finally put a dot at the end of that
  chapter. That is how I would say fate is what brought this entire album into
  existence.
