    I was born in Riga, Latvia. When I turned 6 my family moved to
    Odessa, Ukraine and later on to USA. At the age of 14 when I
    first grabbed a guitar and started playing I realized music was
    my destiny. I wrote and composed my first song
    “Years as the clouds” when I was 15 years old. My life and
    inspiration began when I gave my life to Christ; He led me
    through my darkest times. For me a song is like a cry from the
    heart. When thoughts hit my hands I start writing and composing.

    I was born in Odessa, Ukraine. Music was always the life changing
    experience in my life. First, I hated it during my 5 years of
    piano lessons, and then was inspired by it. I am grateful to God,
    that my teenage years I was able to spend with my “CHANCE”
    brothers serving Christ and not my sinful nature.

    I was born in Russia. From beginning of 7th grade I started
    playing a Saxophone in jazz band. Growing up surrounded by church
    friends and attending lots of youth activities I participated
    singing in worship groups. In 1999 three musketeers from Odessa
    Serg, Vadim and Aleksey formed a music band and have invited me
    to join. Since then we are still together with one goal and one
    destiny to be an encouragement to the world.
