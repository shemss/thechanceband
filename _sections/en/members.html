  bio: >
    I was born in Riga, Latvia. At age six my family moved to Odessa,
    Ukraine and from there we immigrated to the USA.
    <span class="more more-inline" style="display: none;">
      I first picked up a guitar at age fourteen and at once was
      passionate about playing. I knew that music was my destiny.
      I composed my first song "Years Like the Clouds" a year later,
      and the rest is history! My passion for music grew stronger as it
      combined with my faith in Christ. As He led me through my darkest
      times, I used music to express my devotion and feelings. For me
      a song is like a cry from the heart; the thoughts in my mind come
      to life through my composition and music.

    I'm originally from Odessa, Ukraine and later moved to the USA.
    I was fortunate that in my youth Jesus Christ found me.

      My life has been infinitely richer through my unfaltering faith.
      Through Him I found my love of music and my closest friends. My
      path to music came from following in the footsteps of my brothers
      who played guitars. Soon after we started our band. Our hope and
      goal is that through our music we praise His name and touch souls
      with our musical expression of His greatness.

    I was born in Odessa, Ukraine. Surprisingly, at first, music was not
    my passion by any means.
    <span class="more more-inline" style="display: none;">
      During my first five years of piano lessons I hated it! As time
      passed, and my connection to God strengthened, my love of music
      grew. I found a way to express my faith through making music. I am
      grateful to God to leading me down His path and the connection to
      my brothers in CHANCE. He has led me away from sin and to a life
      of servitude of the Lord.

    I was born in Russia. I started playing the saxophone in a jazz band
    at the beginning of seventh grade.
    <span class="more more-inline" style="display: none;">
      Growing up surrounded by church friends I had plenty of time to
      practice my music; youth groups gave me the chance to sing in
      worship groups. The "Three Musketeers from Odessa" - also known
      as Serg, Vadim and Aleksey - started a band in 1996. I was thrilled
      to be asked to join their band in 1999 when they came to USA. Almost
      twenty years later, we are still together with the same united goal
      - to bring inspiration, faith and encouragement to the world through
      our musical expression of His love.
