  <h1>Taking the Chance - Since 1996</h1>
  <p>
    Chance came together as a band in 1996. We pooled our individual musical
    talents, and combined faith and love of Christ, to create music that would
    inspire and bring joy to those who listen. Our music and love of the Lord
    has made us brothers, enriched our lives and faith, and has led those we
    touched to Christ. We hope that you will find the same joy. Take the Chance
    and listen.
